WIPER and General examination
=============================

In an examination the mnemonic **WIPER** may serve as a reminder to wash
your hands, introduce yourself, gain permission, expose the patient and
reposition them as appropriate for the examination about to be
performed. Simultaenously you should carry out a general examination
noting the patients appearance, condition, and any clues from the
environment. This forms the beginning of your mental account of the
patient and can be remembered as ACC. See *General Examination and
Observations* for more detail. The standard format that follows is
always inspection, palpation, percussion, auscultation, and
contemplation (Osler, Canadian turn of 19C physician, father of modern
medicine). Additionally it is helpful to carry out the examination
routine in a set sequence for example general, hands, neck, face, then
specific, in this case, the chest wall. Finish by carrying out, or
listing, relevent further clinical examinations and investigations, and
presenting your findings. **N.B.** It’s a good idea to aim to be able to
define, explain, and suggest a differential for any finding that you
report.

Cardiovascular examination
==========================

General inspection
------------------

Is the patient fat? Obesity is a risk factor for heart disease Is the
patient thin? Weight loss is a symptom of heart failure Is the patient
SOB, do they have ankle oedema, a raised JVP? Could be heart failure Is
there a midline stenotomy scar? Is there evidence of harvesting of the
long saphenous vein? Is there a relevent spot diagnosis? E.g Malar
flush, thyrotoxicosis, etc Are they attached to a cardiac monitor? If so
what does it show?

Hands
-----

-   Is there tar staining, clubbing (test), cyanosis (could be
    hypoxaemia or peripheral vasoconstriction), abnormalities of
    peripheral perfusion (hands warm and pink, cap refill \< 3s normal)
    stigmata of infective endocarditis (splinter haemorrhages, osler’s
    nodes, janeway lesions)

-   Radial pulse, rate, rhythm, radioradial delay, collapsing pulse if
    no pain in shoulder. BP (left and right) ALWAYS ask for it/say you
    would do it if you don’t do it.

Neck
----

-   Carotid pulse, character (normal, collapsing, bounding, slow-rising,
    ?pulsus paradoxus) ?bisferans, alternans

-   JVP (raised, normal, cannon a wave, large v wave etc)
    (abdominojugular reflux sign)

Face
----

Eyes, signs of hyperlipemia such as xanthelasma, corneal arcus. Mouth,
central cyanosis, dentition.

Chest wall, anterior and posterior
----------------------------------

### Inspection

Put your hands behind your head, scars (look at legs for harvesting of
long saphenous vein too), abnormal pulsations

### Palpation

Apex beat, position, character, heaves and thrills

### Percussion

No percussion in a CVS exam

### Auscultation

-   Listen first with bell, feel carotid simultaenously. Roll pt. to
    left (mitral stenosis) Mitral, tricuspid, pulmonary, aortic regions,
    HS I + II, added sounds? Mumour? Where loudest? Systolic/diastolic?
    Radiating? Sit forward expire hold (aortic regurg) carotids expire
    hold (carotid bruit).

-   Auscultate lung bases, check for sacral oedema and ankle oedema

Completion
==========

Either do these things and/or say ”To complete my examination I
would....\`\`

Further examinations
--------------------

Peripheral pulses (peripheral vascuar examination), varicose veins
(legs), liver (abdomen), fundoscopy (hypertensive retinopathy, diabetic
retinopathy ?papillary oedema etc)

Further investigations
----------------------

-   Simple tests: urine dipstix, glucose, microscopic haematuria (\*if\*
    you’re thinking IE)

-   Blood tests: Fbc, U&E’s, inflammatory markers, cardiac enzymes

-   Imaging: ECG, CXR,

-   Special test: ETT, echocardiogram, angiography, thallium scan, 24
    hour tape for arrythmias.
