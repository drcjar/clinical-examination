Summary: Respiratory examination

WIPER and General examination
=============================

In an examination the mnemonic **WIPER** may serve as a reminder to wash
your hands, introduce yourself, gain permission, expose the patient and
reposition them as appropriate for the examination about to be
performed. Simultaenously you should carry out a general examination
noting the patients appearance, condition, and any clues from the
environment. This forms the beginning of your mental account of the
patient and can be remembered as ACC. See *General Examination and
Observations* for more detail. The standard format that follows is
always inspection, palpation, percussion, auscultation, and
contemplation (Osler, Canadian turn of 19C physician, father of modern
medicine). Additionally it is helpful to carry out the examination
routine in a set sequence for example general, hands, neck, face, then
specific, in this case, the chest wall. Finish by carrying out, or
listing, relevent further clinical examinations and investigations, and
presenting your findings. **N.B.** It’s a good idea to aim to be able to
define, explain, and suggest a differential for any finding that you
report.

Respiratory examination
=======================

General inspection
------------------

Is the patient fat? Chest wall disease, Obstructive sleep apnoea Is the
patient thin? COPD, cancer Are there signs of respiratory distress?
Breathlessness, nasal flaring, pursed lip breathing, tracheal tug,
accessory muscle usage, cyanosis. Do you know what the accessory muscles
are? Inspiratory: Sternocleidomastoids, scalenes, pectoralis major,
pectoralis minor, serratus anterior. Expiration: abdominal muscles
(external oblique, internal oblique, rectus abdominalis) Is there a
relevent spot diagnosis? E.g Horners syndrome

Hands
-----

Is there clubbing (Shamroths sign), can you give a differential if there
is?, tar staining, cyanosis, C02 retention flap/Asterix, ?B2-agonist
tremor (could it be a benign essential tremor?), palpate wrists for
tenderness (hypertrophic pulmonary osteoarthropathy – from lung ca).
Take the radial pulse and RR, listen to and watch pt. breathing,
paradoxical breathing? (due to flattened diaphragm in emphysema),
prolonged expiratory phase? (obstructive disease).

Neck
----

Is the JVP elevated (cor pulmonale?) is there cervical lymphadenopathy
(or better to do later from behind).

Face
----

Is there conjunctival pallor (anaemia could make you SOB), does the
patient have a plethoric facies (COPD can make you polycythamic),
horners syndrome, mouth – central cyanosis, oral thrush (inhaled steroid
use).

Chest wall, anterior and posterior
----------------------------------

### Inspection

Is the chest symmetrical? Is there deformity? Are there any scars - look
under arms, and at the back later too - why?

### Palpation

Trachea, apex beat, chest expansion, tactile vocal fremitus ’99’ or
\`\`toy boat\`\` or \`\`neun und neunzig\`\` :-)

### Percussion

Include clavicles and axilla.

### Auscultation

Any crackles, bronchial breathing, pleural rub, wheeze? Vocal resonance
(if you forgot tactile vocal fremitus or prefer it).

Completion
==========

Either do these things and/or say ”To complete my examination I
would....\`\`

Further examinations
--------------------

Sacral oedema, ankle oedema, signs of DVT (calfs soft and non-tender),
forced expiratory time (normal less than 6s), PEFR (peak flow), sputum
pot.

Further investigations
----------------------

-   Simple tests: peak flow, spirometry, urine dipstix, glucose, sputum
    cultures, pulse oximetry, ABG

-   Blood tests: Fbc, U&E’s, Ca, blood cultures, inflammatory markers

-   Imaging: CXR, bronchoscopy, pulmonary angiography, doppler legs
