General examination
===================

Note the patients appearance, condition, and any clues from the
environment. This forms the beginning of your mental account of the
patient and can be remembered as ACC.

Appearance
----------

Age, race, sex, body habitus (fat/thin). Does the patient display any
features which are only present in disease? These features can be
remembered with the mnemonic **JACCOLT FDM**.

-   Jaundice (look for scleral yellowing)

-   Anaemia (look for conjunctival pallor)

-   Cyanosis (look at peripheries and mouth)

-   Lymphadenopathy (cervical, axillary, inguinal etc)

-   Thyroid (is there a goitre?)

-   Fever (is the patient hot and sweaty?)

-   Dehydration (is the patient thirsty, are the mucous membranes moist,
    is skin turgor reduced, is there a postural drop in blood pressure?)

-   Malnutrition (does the patient look over or under nourished, are the
    cachectic? Do they have a large body habitus?)

Condition
---------

Do they look alert? Are they comfortable? Are they in pain? Are they
tachypnoeic, are there signs of respiratory distress?

Clues
-----

Does the patient have any connections? E.g Cannulae, catheter, central
line, oxygen etc. Does the bedside yield any clues? E.g Sputum pot,
inhaler, walking stick, mars bars, fruit etc.

Observations
============

What the patients most recent recorded observations. In particular, what
is their:

-   Temperature

-   Blood pressure

-   Pulse

-   Respiratory rate

-   Oxygen saturation

-   Urine output/Drain output/Stoma output etc if these are relevent.

**N.B.** It may be necessary to break to a DR ABCDE approach if the
routine reveals that the patient is acutely unwell.
