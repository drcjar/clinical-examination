Summary: Cranial nerve examination


WIPER and General examination
=============================

In an examination the mnemonic **WIPER** may serve as a reminder to wash
your hands, introduce yourself, gain permission, expose the patient and
reposition them as appropriate for the examination about to be
performed. Simultaenously you should carry out a general examination
noting the patients appearance, condition, and any clues from the
environment. This forms the beginning of your mental account of the
patient and can be remembered as ACC. See *General Examination and
Observations* for more detail. The standard format that follows is
always inspection, palpation, percussion, auscultation, and
contemplation (Osler, Canadian turn of 19C physician, father of modern
medicine). Additionally it is helpful to carry out the examination
routine in a set sequence for example general, hands, neck, face, then
specific, in this case, the chest wall. Finish by carrying out, or
listing, relevent further clinical examinations and investigations, and
presenting your findings. **N.B.** It’s a good idea to aim to be able to
define, explain, and suggest a differential for any finding that you
report.

Cranial Nerve examination
=========================

General inspection
------------------

-   Is there a facial palsy?

-   Is there abnormal posturing? (you should spot an hemipariesis)

-   Does patient seem confused? (you would also like to establish the
    AMTS and test higher mental function - 7 domains

    1.  Consciousness i.e GCS

    2.  Orientation to person, place and time

    3.  Attention and Concentration (subcortical function) (digit span
        test, serial 7’s, WORLD)

    4.  Language and Speech (frontotemporal lobe, cerebellum,
        musculature) (Dysphasia/Dysarthria)

    5.  Memory (temporal/parietal lobes) (antereograde/reterograde,
        implicit/expicit, verbal/non-verbal)

    6.  Visuospatial skills (non-dominant hemisphere) (geographical
        orientation, constructional dyspraxia, dressing dyspraxia)

    7.  Executive functioning (frontal lobe) (proverb interpretation,
        verbal fluency, cognitive estimates, Luria’s FEP - fist, edge,
        palm, utilisation behaviour, appropriate behaviour)

-   Is there an NG tube?

-   Are there any disability aids at the bedside?

Cranial Nerves
--------------

-   I ’any change in your sense of taste or smell’

-   II visual acuity with snellen chart (with glasses, without and with
    pin hole) ishihara plates visual fields testing inc bilateral
    challenge fundoscopy reflexes, accomodation and direct and
    consensual pupillary reflexes (PERRLA D+C, pupils equal, round, and
    reactive to light, both direct and consesual response, and
    accomodation)

-   III, IV, VI ’follow my finger’ tell me if it goes blury or you see
    double at any point’

-   V sensory, opthalmic, maxillary, mandibular, ’can you feel me
    touching’ ’does it feel the same on both sides?’ motor, ’clench your
    jaw’ feel masseutus and temporalis reflexes, jaw jerk and corneal
    reflex

-   VII ’Raise your eye brows’ ’Screw up your eyes’ ’Blow out your
    cheeks’ ’Big smile, show me your teeth’

-   VIII ’I’m going to whisper a number into your ear, please repeat the
    number’ (distract by rubbing fingers) Rinne’s and Weber’s tests

-   IX, X gag reflex and swallowing open mouth and say ’arrh’ (look at
    uvula – shd see rise centrally)

-   XI ’shrug your shoulders against my hands’ ’try and turn your head
    against my hand’

-   XII ’stick your tounge out. And move it side to side’ (inspect
    tounge for wasting and fasiculation)

Completion
==========

Either do these things and/or say ”To complete my examination I
would....\`\`

Further examinations
--------------------

Higher mental function testing, Peripheral nervous system testing,
Cardiovascular examination (e.g for carotid bruit, AF in stroke patient)

Further investigations
----------------------

-   Simple tests: urine dipstix

-   Blood tests: Fbc, U&E’s, inflammatory markers, glucose, lipids,
    clotting

-   Imaging: ECG, CXR, CT Head, MRI

-   Special test: echocardiogram, doppler USS carotids
